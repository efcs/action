# This file defines pre-commit CI for libc++, libc++abi, and libunwind (on Github).
#
# We split the configurations in multiple stages with the intent of saving compute time
# when a job fails early in the pipeline. This is why the jobs are marked as `continue-on-error: false`.
# We try to run the CI configurations with the most signal in the first stage.
#
# Stages 1 & 2 are meant to be "smoke tests", and are meant to catch most build/test failures quickly and without using
# too many resources.
# Stage 3 is "everything else", and is meant to catch breakages on more niche or unique configurations.
#
# Therefore, we "fail-fast" for any failures during stages 1 & 2, meaning any job failing cancels all other running jobs,
# under the assumption that if the "smoke tests" fail, then the other configurations will likely fail in the same way.
# However, stage 3 does not fail fast, as it's more likely that any one job failing is a flake or a configuration-specific
